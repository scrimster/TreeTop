# TreeTop - Forest Canopy Analysis App

TreeTop is an iOS application designed for forest canopy analysis using computer vision and machine learning. The app allows users to capture and analyze forest canopy images to determine canopy coverage percentages.

## Features

- **Project Management**: Create and organize forest analysis projects
- **Camera Integration**: Capture high-quality forest canopy photos
- **GPS Location Tracking**: Record precise location data for each analysis
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Uses Core ML models to analyze canopy coverage
- **Data Export**: Generate PDF reports with analysis results
- **Map Integration**: View project locations on an interactive map

## Technical Stack

- **Framework**: SwiftUI
- **Data Persistence**: SwiftData
- **Machine Learning**: Core ML
- **Camera**: AVFoundation
- **Location Services**: Core Location
- **Map Integration**: MapKit

## Requirements

- iOS 17.0+
- Xcode 15.0+
- Swift 5.9+

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Open `TreeTop.xcodeproj` in Xcode
3. Build and run the project

## Usage
